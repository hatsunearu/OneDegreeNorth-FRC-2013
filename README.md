------

This repo contains the robot code, written in Java, for 2013's First Robotics Competition, Ultimate Ascent. 

The code is licensed with the FreeBSD license. 

The code is fairly self-explannatory, with sane class names and variable names.

There are total of 4 classes as of the most recent revision. SASIterativeRobot is the main class, which uses instances of the other 3 classes which operate subssystems of 1°N's robot. It inherits from the Iterative Robot template.
